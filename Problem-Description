Use Case:
Currently, there are multiple banking and insurance industries who are trying to implement their business models on hadoop technologies. 
Main issue they are facing is to convert the existing mainframe file layouts to hadoop file layout. This is extremely painful process as there multiple complications in conversion. 

Pain Areas:
Below are some of the list:
1. EBCDIC format to ASCII conversion
2. Field separations are based on offset instead of separators. 
3. array <structures> is determined run time using to previous fields (For Eg: WS-FIELD OCCURS 1 TO 50 TIMES DEPENDING ON WS-FIELD-LENGTH. )
4. REDEFINES of particular previous fields.
5. ...

Current work around:
Most of the industries are adding an additional layers in between mainframe and hadoop to convert the formats.

Proposed Solution:
Develop a custom Serde which exhibits below properties:
1. Cobol Layout is supplied through TBL PROPERTIES similar to AvroSerde and it will build the hive table definition automatically.
2. Deserailzer should be able to extract the field data based on the offset at runtime.
3. EBCDIC to ASCII to conversion is enabled through a property in TBLPROPERTIES
4. ...

Benefits:
1. Easier migration from mainframe systems to hadoop
2. Removal of additional layers.
3. ..

Cobol Layout:
01 WS-VAR. 
   05 WS-NAME PIC X(12). 
   05 WS-MARKS-LENGTH PIC 9(2). 
   05 WS-marks OCCURS 0 to 25 TIMES DEPENDING ON WS-MARKS-LENGTH. 
      10 WS-MARK PIC 999. 
   05 WS-NICKNAME PIC X(6)

Hive DDL:

CREATE TABLE Cobol2Hive

LOCATION '/home/hduser/hive/warehouse/ram.db/lolol'
TBLPROPERTIES ('cobol.layout'='01 WS-VAR. 05 WS-NAME PIC X(12). 05 WS-MARKS-LENGTH PIC 9(2). 05 WS-marks OCCURS 0 to 25 TIMES DEPENDING ON WS-MARKS-LENGTH. 10 WS-MARK PIC 999. 05 WS-NICKNAME PIC X(6)');
